Determine whether the question can be completed by a set of Azure CLI commands. If not, please output empty array [] and end this task.\n2. Analyze the steps related to Azure CLI commands in this question and confirm each step must correspond to a single Azure CLI command.\n3. Output corresponding descriptions for each step without meaningless conjunctions. If a step can be completed by using an Azure CLI command that you know, output the corresponding command and parameters info of this step after the step description. Use \"||\" as a separator between step and command information.\n4. Ignore the step which contains general Azure CLI commands unrelated to specific scenarios in the question (such as \"az group create\", \"az login\").\n5. Ignore the step which contains non Azure CLI commands that do not start with \"az\" (such as docker, bash and kubectl commads).\n6. Ignore the step which contains the description unrelated to Azure CLI commands.\n7. If this question is too complex and requires many steps to be split, then only retain up to 8 of the most core steps.\nFinally, output the results as a JSON array.",
